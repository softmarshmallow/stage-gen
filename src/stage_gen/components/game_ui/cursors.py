"""The cursor set: a fixed pointer vocabulary a game may restyle, each glyph with a hotspot.

A mouse cursor is an icon with one more fact: the pixel that is the pointer. The set is
built like the preview icon grid, and for the same reason — an image model draws a named
pointer arrow, a pointing hand or an hourglass dependably and a bespoke pointer not — so
the glyphs, their order, the grid and the hotspot rule per glyph belong to the layout, and
the authored prompt is style direction alone.

The hotspot is measured, never declared by hand and never read off the template. Each
glyph names the rule the gate applies to the alpha it actually drew: a pointer arrow's
hotspot is its tip, the topmost-leftmost opaque pixel; a pointing hand's is the fingertip,
the middle of the topmost opaque row; every symmetric shape's is the centre of its drawn
bounds. The manifest publishes the hotspot beside the cell in sheet pixels relative to the
cell's origin, so a consumer scales the cell to its cursor size and scales the hotspot by
the same factor. Whether the arrow reads as an arrow, and points where its rule assumes, is
the review's question; the evidence marks every measured hotspot on the glyph for it.

The grid fills its canvas the way the icon grid does, because that is the condition under
which the model honours a template at all: the first cut, eight cells as a small island inside
a wide margin on a 3:2 canvas, was ignored on every draw — the model laid the pointers out on a
grid of its own across the whole canvas, drawn well and registered nowhere. Nine pointers on a
3x3 grid tile a 1024 square with the icon grid's own margins; the ninth is the text I-beam,
the one remaining pointer every desktop knows.
