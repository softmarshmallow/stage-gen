"""Reviewer quality bar: one labeled atlas at the height that decides the verdict.

SD characters are consumed at mobile gameplay scale, so the reviewer judges one
atlas whose cells are rendered at the bar's character height. `low` means the
character is usable in a game: nothing broken at the smallest declared gameplay
height. `medium` uses the largest declared gameplay height and a more explicit
per-boundary policy. `high` is declared for later close-up work and refused
before any spend. Each level needs its own calibration; none transfers.
