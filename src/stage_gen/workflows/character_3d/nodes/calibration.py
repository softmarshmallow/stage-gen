"""A frozen rig as the rig reviewer's subject: what calibrates the reviewer.

A calibration subject is a finished provider-rig export frozen with the facts it was
labelled under (``rig_review_subject_v2``): its clips, its numeric findings and the weights
it misses. ``subject`` measures the export in Blender and writes the rig record the
workflow's own ``finish`` would have written, so the workflow's own rig review judges it
unchanged. The labels never reach a run; a calibration compares verdicts with them later.
