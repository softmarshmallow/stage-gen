"""Medium contracts: the production language a universe package is rendered in.

Medium is a first-class package input (``universe.toml`` ``medium``). It enters
before concept compilation, not only at the final image prompt, because the
benchmark proved a compiler that speaks one medium overrules any renderer that
speaks another. Nothing in the semantic proposal is medium-specific.

Backgrounds are silhouette-first paintings made from four to six large value groups, simplified material planes, and a small controlled brush vocabulary. Detail decreases sharply with distance. Native resolution is for clean edges, stable anatomy, readable mechanics, and theatrical print clarity, not microtexture.

Preserve richness through one crisp subject-and-action detail island and at most one selectively articulated environmental identity cluster per depth plane; merge repeated bark marks, leaves, masonry units, scaffold members, and ropes into broad grouped shapes.
