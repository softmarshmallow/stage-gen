"""Locked 47-mask terrain-atlas recipe and deterministic compositor.

The sheet is requested at an exact canvas and sliced on fixed boundaries. GPT Image 2.5
honours an exact ``size`` up to 3840 px and 3:1, and a 12-by-4 atlas is exactly 3:1, so a
2880-by-960 request comes back at 2880 by 960 and every cell edge is known before the
draw. That retires the cyan guide lattice, the fitted-residual admission and the
asymmetric crop inset, none of which were ever about the art.

It also retires magenta. The keep-out convention was designed before native alpha existed
and it had been quietly destroying the sheet: the locked template paints its rock
highlights in a pale pink that satisfies the chroma key, so every published atlas carried
holes where the key had eaten solid ground -- 31,701 transparent pixels, 4.68 per cent of
the forty-seven tiles, up to 19.2 per cent of one of them. The per-cell alpha that the
old admission compared against was that damage, not a silhouette: it is anti-correlated
with exposure, open along tops that are *covered* and closed along tops that are exposed,
and it collapses to six distinct shapes across forty-seven masks. A 3x3-minimal terrain
tile fills its cell. There is nothing to key, so the sheet is drawn and published opaque.

#: Removing it was the largest non-model change between the atlas that worked and the one
#: that did not: without it the model paints the sheet as one canvas, and a cell whose side
#: should terminate never gets a face at all. Measured on the sheet it replaces, colour
#: right across a boundary differed by 2.78 where half a cell apart differed by 8.35, and
#: cells whose bottom is exposed sat 2.13 from the cell below - their undersides were the

_OBJECT_BLOCK_DISTANCE: Final = 12.0
#: Recorded, never refused. Three attempts to make this a gate produced two regressions

#: best (0.194) and the contract came back asking for gravel: largest feature 20 px of a
#: 120 px tile against 52 in the atlas it replaced. At 0.45 it fought the fabric the prompt
#: now asks for and exhausted a node's whole retry budget on a material that draws big
#: slabs. And the ordering never worked: the atlas a reviewer liked scores 0.157 on its
#: largest region, a hillside visibly chained with repeated boulders scores 0.179, and a
#: sheet that reads well scores 0.345. Whether a repeat is legible is an aesthetic
#: judgement - a course of slabs reads as a wall, one boulder reads as a copy - and no
#: statistic tried here separates them. The number stays in the record because it is worth
#: comparing across runs; the judgement belongs to the semantic review.
#: The worst mean-channel tone step allowed across any join the validation maps can make.
#: Calibrated on published atlases rather than on a new draw: the two whose material a
#: semantic reviewer accepted measure 26.3, the one the reviewer complained about measures
#: 84.6, and a repeat draw that came back visibly patchy measures 92.8.
