"""The UI sheet roles: geometry, gates, review questions and the manifest projection.

Every 2D game draws panels, buttons and a few system icons, so this is the one piece of
generation that is genuinely the same work in every genre: the geometry template, the
pixel gate and the review question do not know which genre asked for them. Three sheet
families share one shape. A nine-slice role (``panel_frame``, ``button_rect``) is gated by
slice reconstruction and published with insets; the preview icon grid is gated by cell
registration and published with glyph bounds; the cursor set is the icon grid's gate with
one measured hotspot per glyph. Only each family's own template, gate, evidence and review
question differ, and they are looked up from the role. The build steps that draw them are
``demo_game_tools.steps.ui_atlas``. Nothing here reads a game, a genre, or a camera.
